I graduated from  UC Berkeley where I studied Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and History.

I started a company called sidelineHD and we were recently [acquired by Diamond Kinetics](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/03/07/diamond-kinetics-sideline-hd-acquisition)

I do some sports analytics work, some of which is public on this blog.

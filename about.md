I'm a recent grad of UC Berkeley where I studied Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and History.

I'm currently exploring new ideas :)

I used to write code at Nextdoor.

I do some sports analytics work, some of which is public on this blog.

I love playing (swimming, cycling, running, basketball) and watching (football, basketball, ...everything) sports.

I like art and classical music a lot. [Here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6WOePWTRD8B3sihIl0zoKk?si=zvQvYoHkSXKStqQsOecVjQ) is what I am currently listening to.

I try to read, but like everyone else, "I don't have time." My reading list is on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67880573-canzhi-ye).

Not super updated [résumé](http://bit.ly/canzhi_resume)

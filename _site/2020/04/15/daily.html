    <p>I’m on a lighter week of running / biking this week after three pretty tough weeks. I’ll actually still try to up my run mileage after feeling really good running pretty easy on Monday. I did a steady 5mi @ 7:00 pace today and it never felt too fast, so I was pretty pleased by that. I’m still wary of doing too much faster running, so will probably just chill below 8:00 for the rest of my miles this week.</p>

<p>I’m happy about being productive today, and it’s a really good feeling to be in flow state, just letting irrelevant shit not use up any brain cycles. I wonder if consistency around sleeping / waking up can help with achieving sustained productivity / flow state across days instead of just within days. Everything is just blending together anyways. The internet has become reality. [insert something something Baudrillardian hyperreality]</p>

<p>Kostya was able to test using deaths data instead of cases data on this kind of novel take trying to estimate real-time rate of transmission by just changing a few lines of code because OP made it public. So much easier to trust data analysis that is reproduceable too.</p>

<p>Really sad Wired article about Lee Holloway and the effects of FTD on not only him, but his family, friends, and coworkers.</p>

<p><a href="https://overcast.fm/+Lv5PFcn0g">good overview of “advanced” stats in soccer</a>. I’ve been dabbling in doing some predictive modeling for soccer after I stumbled upon some event data and this was an easy to listen to overview of the more popular parts (not cutting edge) of soccer analytics.</p>

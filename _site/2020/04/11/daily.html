<p>This week was my biggest biking week ever - 178 miles and over 12 hours in the saddle. If I do my long run tomorrow (pending how my achilles feel), I‚Äôll have completed 15 hours of cardio this week. If all goes well, it‚Äôd be fun to race once that‚Äôs a thing again and see the progress. Next week will be a lighter week to make sure I‚Äôm not getting too fatigued after three pretty big weeks by my standards.</p>

<p>I want to expand on this take a little bit. It‚Äôs never been clearer to me that the media has no interest in searching for truth. They just want to feed the masses; produce lowest common denominator content. A great example of this is the growing genre of ‚Äúwhat we can learn from how X handled coronavirus.‚Äù We‚Äôre so early in understanding anything about covid, the context behind every country is so different, and the quality of data presented as evidence in these articles is so poor.</p>

<p>These inter-country comparisons really stoke the flames of the incessant online culture wars. People will conflate properties of a country‚Äôs political system with how well they‚Äôve allegedly handled coronavirus, and suggest that if the US did a bunch of completely unrelated political things, then coronavirus would be less severe here too. This stuff is either intentionally intellectually dishonest‚Ä¶ or people‚Äôs brains are completely broken- they‚Äôre just out here building their narratives, their personal brands.</p>

<p>I absolutely need to stop listening to news podcasts. It‚Äôs filling my brain with noise‚Ä¶ basically static.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt even like baseball, but any content that Jon Bois produces, I will gladly consume. Voraciously. His new (ongoing) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pkVu6Kw00M">series</a> on the Seattle Mariners is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f6owc3O_gY&amp;list=PLNuxWfBvNtJl6qJhs40VPsxKxgZnFqBoh">pretty good</a> (ha ha).</p>

<p>He‚Äôs probably one of the most underrated geniuses of this century. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oNB6tlSZ2A&amp;list=PLUXSZMIiUfFRSunlJERh9k1RFNnGGhnzG">His 5-part MMA documentary</a> examines the relationship between labor, fighting, and our postmodern condition. It has &lt;1M views. Dumb clickbait shit by Buzzfeed has tens of millions of views. Bullshit. People lack taste.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt really like following national politics, but Bernie dropping out did make me spend a few brain cycles here. After being the favorite post Iowa / New Hampshire / Nevada, he somehow still failed to be recognized as a legit mainstream candidate. <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FOOTuytv0">The Weeds did a good episode</a> about what‚Äôs next and what to take away from his candidacy. If his most vocal supporters are representative at all of his wider support, I‚Äôm becoming increasingly concerned that they‚Äôll either sit out the election or vote for Trump. In fact, a second term for Trump definitely adds more to the narrative that running a moderate candidate doesn‚Äôt work (Hillary 2016, Biden 2020), whether that‚Äôs actually true or not. It almost makes more sense for the hardcore Bernie supporters to just vote for Trump. Anyway, I don‚Äôt really add anything to the politics discourse, so I will stop here.</p>

<p>I watched a Zwift race for the first time this week! Is this esports? The race is somewhat gamified through powerups, but ultimately, the competitors still have to do the thing they‚Äôd do for the actual sport. So maybe not really an esport. Interested in seeing how this evolves!</p>

&lt;p&gt;This week was my biggest biking week ever - 178 miles and over 12 hours in the saddle. If I do my long run tomorrow (pending how my achilles feel), I‚Äôll have completed 15 hours of cardio this week. If all goes well, it‚Äôd be fun to race once that‚Äôs a thing again and see the progress. Next week will be a lighter week to make sure I‚Äôm not getting too fatigued after three pretty big weeks by my standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to expand on this take a little bit. It‚Äôs never been clearer to me that the media has no interest in searching for truth. They just want to feed the masses; produce lowest common denominator content. A great example of this is the growing genre of ‚Äúwhat we can learn from how X handled coronavirus.‚Äù We‚Äôre so early in understanding anything about covid, the context behind every country is so different, and the quality of data presented as evidence in these articles is so poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These inter-country comparisons really stoke the flames of the incessant online culture wars. People will conflate properties of a country‚Äôs political system with how well they‚Äôve allegedly handled coronavirus, and suggest that if the US did a bunch of completely unrelated political things, then coronavirus would be less severe here too. This stuff is either intentionally intellectually dishonest‚Ä¶ or people‚Äôs brains are completely broken- they‚Äôre just out here building their narratives, their personal brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely need to stop listening to news podcasts. It‚Äôs filling my brain with noise‚Ä¶ basically static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt even like baseball, but any content that Jon Bois produces, I will gladly consume. Voraciously. His new (ongoing) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pkVu6Kw00M&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; on the Seattle Mariners is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f6owc3O_gY&amp;amp;list=PLNuxWfBvNtJl6qJhs40VPsxKxgZnFqBoh&quot;&gt;pretty good&lt;/a&gt; (ha ha).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He‚Äôs probably one of the most underrated geniuses of this century. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oNB6tlSZ2A&amp;amp;list=PLUXSZMIiUfFRSunlJERh9k1RFNnGGhnzG&quot;&gt;His 5-part MMA documentary&lt;/a&gt; examines the relationship between labor, fighting, and our postmodern condition. It has &amp;lt;1M views. Dumb clickbait shit by Buzzfeed has tens of millions of views. Bullshit. People lack taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt really like following national politics, but Bernie dropping out did make me spend a few brain cycles here. After being the favorite post Iowa / New Hampshire / Nevada, he somehow still failed to be recognized as a legit mainstream candidate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+FOOTuytv0&quot;&gt;The Weeds did a good episode&lt;/a&gt; about what‚Äôs next and what to take away from his candidacy. If his most vocal supporters are representative at all of his wider support, I‚Äôm becoming increasingly concerned that they‚Äôll either sit out the election or vote for Trump. In fact, a second term for Trump definitely adds more to the narrative that running a moderate candidate doesn‚Äôt work (Hillary 2016, Biden 2020), whether that‚Äôs actually true or not. It almost makes more sense for the hardcore Bernie supporters to just vote for Trump. Anyway, I don‚Äôt really add anything to the politics discourse, so I will stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched a Zwift race for the first time this week! Is this esports? The race is somewhat gamified through powerups, but ultimately, the competitors still have to do the thing they‚Äôd do for the actual sport. So maybe not really an esport.

So many people shared the ‚ÄúUS surpasses Italy in confirmed coronaviruses cases‚Äù news today. Guess what? It‚Äôs fucking meaningless! We could‚Äôve looked at the growth rate some days ago and known this was going to happen. Additionally, once again, confirmed cases aren‚Äôt a great metric (more below). If I‚Äôm going to spend brain cycles on coronavirus, I want to think critically, go beneath the surface, and explore data myself‚Ä¶ OR make memes. Not share these normie-ass articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-order effects of these braindead articles are odd. I‚Äôve even seen it lead to some of my Facebook friends (who are a lost cause by now ‚Äì they still think this is nothing more than the flu) to proclaim that ‚ÄúWELL ACTUALLY Italy still has more cases per capita.‚Äù Wow they must be so smart to know how to divide a number by the population of a country. Many of these people like to talk about how the media is incentivized to spin stories to attract clicks / views, and how because of this we can‚Äôt trust the media. In some ways, I share their disdain‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started poking around at some of the different sources of covid related out there. covidtracking.com is really doing a lot of the thankless work around cleaning data from many different sources ‚Äì very much appreciated. I have a public notebook with some code here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qr6G1dxj9I1OlAdxqlZECFQdqfV9RDps&quot;&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qr6G1dxj9I1OlAdxqlZECFQdqfV9RDps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm trying to find the right questions to ask ‚Äì they should be answerable from available data, help people get a clearer view of what is actually going on, and not already discussed ad naseum. I‚Äôm hesitant to do any forecasting because of lack of domain knowledge, and I certainly don‚Äôt want to add more noise to an already incredibly exhausting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-vs-confirmed-cases&quot;&gt;Testing vs Confirmed cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a good thread by a buddy on the high correlation between number of tests and confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;FYI: the growth in positive test results per &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@COVID19Tracking&lt;/a&gt; data maps almost 1:1 with the growth in tests performed : R^2 of 0.97. In other words, reporting new and daily case counts is really just reporting on the ramp up in testing capability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DanRosenheck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DanRosenheck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Noahpinion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/T0aZBmVZLm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/T0aZBmVZLm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kostya Medvedovsky (@kmedved) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kmedved/status/1243612191959453697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned from one of the replies that finding R^2 between two time series can lead to spurious correlations though. Curious to see the follow up on this. Or I guess I could do the work myself here‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;random-testing&quot;&gt;Random testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;so reading from the source, it&amp;#39;s a bit nuanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5564 tests on &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; people (prob similar criteria to US). 685 positive. (12%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6163 tests on the general population. 52 positive. (0.8%)&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Koeyjk5loP&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Koeyjk5loP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1243642365631287297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, Iceland is the only country thus far to do random testing of the general population. They lead the world in tests per 1000 at roughly 30. For comparison, the two highest US states are NY and WA, at 7 and 6 respectively. We have data on Iceland‚Äôs randomized tests for 3/20, 3/23, and 3/25 so maybe we can do something with this data. Simple back of the envelope calculation tells us that means there are 2.5M people in the US with the virus if we extrapolate using Iceland‚Äôs rate. There‚Äôs so many other variables that could render the previous sentence completely inccorect that I almost didn‚Äôt want to include it here. Will need to think more about how to best use this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-on-data&quot;&gt;More on data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of data, the NYT released their county-level coronavirus data. I felt kind of misled by their article though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;this is excellent! can you also release this data? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SKwAJo8XCT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SKwAJo8XCT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1243636434268897281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that county-level data isn‚Äôt useful, but seems like getting information about those who actually got the virus would be very useful, or at the very least, interesting to analyze. Perhaps there is county-level demographic and health data that is easily accessible that I could merge with the NYT data‚Ä¶ If I remember to go look for it and find it, I‚Äôll add it to the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking at the testing data from covidtracking.com more closely (with Kostya), I found that the quality was not ideal. There were quite a few days where NY just didn‚Äôt report any negative cases‚Ä¶ Such is real-world data, I guess. With sports, the data quality is usually much higher. When I‚Äôm modeling sports, I feel pretty confident that whatever data is captured is done in a relatively consistent way across games and seasons (still not perfect). It really is a great playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;masks&quot;&gt;Masks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard conflicting information about the efficacy of masks. The WHO dismisses their usefulness as a protective measure for healthy people, and Michael Osterholm (epidemiologist expert) echoed it on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast a couple weeks ago. However, I have also seen a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLrm0pqBN_5bdyysOeoOBX4pt4oFDBhsC_jpblXpNtQ/edit&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; compiling a list of studies that claim that masks are helpful! There‚Äôs just so much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; on the internet that you will get exactly what you search for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know what to believe. Now that the level of seriousness has been ratcheted up, I feel much more aware of how easily misinformation or even half-truths can be spread on social media. This doesn‚Äôt feel like the malicious fake news campaigns from the 2016 election, but more an overconfidence in something where the truth is not known. If anyone asks me if masks are effective, I‚Äôll fall back to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù but if I have to go to the grocery store, I‚Äôll take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager&quot;&gt;Pascal‚Äôs wager&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">People love to read too much into dumb headlines. So many people shared the ‚ÄúUS surpasses Italy in confirmed coronaviruses cases‚Äù news today. Guess what? It‚Äôs fucking meaningless! We could‚Äôve looked at the growth rate some days ago and known this was going to happen. Additionally, once again, confirmed cases aren‚Äôt a great metric (more below). If I‚Äôm going to spend brain cycles on coronavirus, I want to think critically, go beneath the surface, and explore data myself‚Ä¶ OR make memes.

&lt;p&gt;The Weeds on what to do with industry in times like these. Some comparisons to Ford, factories, etc producing necessary things in WWII. It‚Äôs like a car crash - I can‚Äôt not pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still looking to take a deeper dive into the covid data. Lack of domain knowledge caveat applies here, but I think I have a few ideas on how I can add something to the discussion without being absolutely destroyed like &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aginnt&quot;&gt;@aginnt&lt;/a&gt;. Main thing I want to look at is incorporating testing and demographic data to contextualize the confirmed cases graphs I see everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation around KAT‚Äôs mom is really sad. Very brave of him to get in front of a camera and deliver this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffma/status/1242246589395001351&quot;&gt;Bet the Process&lt;/a&gt; episode recorded at Sloan came out today. Interviews with Ted Knutson and Jeff Yass were both insightful. Knutson was pretty negative about the prospects of a thriving regulated &amp;amp; legalized betting market in the US. Or more specifically it‚Äôd only be for recreational bettors. Yass talked about how at SIG they teach all the new traders to play poker first to learn about variance and process-oriented decision making. I think that‚Äôs really cool! I‚Äôm not good at poker, but those aspects of the game appeal to me as well. Playing games with a mix of luck and skill is way more fun than a game like chess, which is a perfect information all skill game. Actually, not only is it way more fun, it is a much more realistic representation of the real world where we never have perfect information.&lt;/p&gt;

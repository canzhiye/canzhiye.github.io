&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten to cook a lot more, which is usually tons of fun, but also so easy for me to feel like I’m running out of ideas with a slightly limited set of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made normal boring stuff like scrambled eggs, pb sandwiches, pasta, burgers, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of the (weirder) stuff I’ve taken pics of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sous vide chicken thighs in some buns…no veggies, so threw some carrots on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/chicken_sandwich.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was okay, but crazy spicy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;what the fuck did i just make &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/aWgyjWpCKs&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aWgyjWpCKs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1243737841600843778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 28, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually hate instant coffee, but I went and grabbed some to make this. Was too much effort to whip it up for a mediocre tasting drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;made the dalgona coffee thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LN2TGzCocg&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LN2TGzCocg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1244331974103142400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sous vide chicken thighs, with Indian-ish flavors (turmeric, ginger, cumin, salt, pepper). I also don’t know why these images aren’t rotated properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/chicken.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braised red cabbage with onions and apples. Didn’t have any carbs, so I threw it in some tortillas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;burning-calories&quot;&gt;Burning calories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did 130 miles on the bike and 19 miles on my feet last week – probably my biggest week of cardio work in a long time, so I was pretty worn out by Sunday. Silver lining of this corona stuff is I’ll hopefully come out of this in top cardio shape, and maybe I’ll do a couple races. I’ve been running way slower (intentionally) than ever before, but I’m hoping it pays off by keeping me free of weird pains and aches that I’ve gotten before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Consuming calories</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Daily: Real-world data and some ranting</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/daily.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Daily: Real-world data and some ranting" /><published>2020-03-27T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-27T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/daily</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/27/daily.html">&lt;p&gt;People love to read too much into dumb headlines. So many people shared the “US surpasses Italy in confirmed coronaviruses cases” news today. Guess what? It’s fucking meaningless! We could’ve looked at the growth rate some days ago and known this was going to happen. Additionally, once again, confirmed cases aren’t a great metric (more below). If I’m going to spend brain cycles on coronavirus, I want to think critically, go beneath the surface, and explore data myself… OR make memes. Not share these normie-ass articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-order effects of these braindead articles are odd. I’ve even seen it lead to some of my Facebook friends (who are a lost cause by now – they still think this is nothing more than the flu) to proclaim that “WELL ACTUALLY Italy still has more cases per capita.” Wow they must be so smart to know how to divide a number by the population of a country. Many of these people like to talk about how the media is incentivized to spin stories to attract clicks / views, and how because of this we can’t trust the media. In some ways, I share their disdain…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started poking around at some of the different sources of covid related out there. covidtracking.com is really doing a lot of the thankless work around cleaning data from many different sources – very much appreciated. I have a public notebook with some code here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qr6G1dxj9I1OlAdxqlZECFQdqfV9RDps&quot;&gt;https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qr6G1dxj9I1OlAdxqlZECFQdqfV9RDps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to find the right questions to ask – they should be answerable from available data, help people get a clearer view of what is actually going on, and not already discussed ad naseum. I’m hesitant to do any forecasting because of lack of domain knowledge, and I certainly don’t want to add more noise to an already incredibly exhausting topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-vs-confirmed-cases&quot;&gt;Testing vs Confirmed cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a good thread by a buddy on the high correlation between number of tests and confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;FYI: the growth in positive test results per &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/COVID19Tracking?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@COVID19Tracking&lt;/a&gt; data maps almost 1:1 with the growth in tests performed : R^2 of 0.97. In other words, reporting new and daily case counts is really just reporting on the ramp up in testing capability. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DanRosenheck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@DanRosenheck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Noahpinion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Noahpinion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/T0aZBmVZLm&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/T0aZBmVZLm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kostya Medvedovsky (@kmedved) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kmedved/status/1243612191959453697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned from one of the replies that finding R^2 between two time series can lead to spurious correlations though. Curious to see the follow up on this. Or I guess I could do the work myself here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;random-testing&quot;&gt;Random testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;so reading from the source, it&amp;#39;s a bit nuanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5564 tests on &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; people (prob similar criteria to US). 685 positive. (12%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6163 tests on the general population. 52 positive. (0.8%)&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Koeyjk5loP&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Koeyjk5loP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1243642365631287297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my knowledge, Iceland is the only country thus far to do random testing of the general population. They lead the world in tests per 1000 at roughly 30. For comparison, the two highest US states are NY and WA, at 7 and 6 respectively. We have data on Iceland’s randomized tests for 3/20, 3/23, and 3/25 so maybe we can do something with this data. Simple back of the envelope calculation tells us that means there are 2.5M people in the US with the virus if we extrapolate using Iceland’s rate. There’s so many other variables that could render the previous sentence completely inccorect that I almost didn’t want to include it here. Will need to think more about how to best use this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-on-data&quot;&gt;More on data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of data, the NYT released their county-level coronavirus data. I felt kind of misled by their article though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;this is excellent! can you also release this data? &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SKwAJo8XCT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/SKwAJo8XCT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1243636434268897281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 27, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that county-level data isn’t useful, but seems like getting information about those who actually got the virus would be very useful, or at the very least, interesting to analyze. Perhaps there is county-level demographic and health data that is easily accessible that I could merge with the NYT data… If I remember to go look for it and find it, I’ll add it to the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In looking at the testing data from covidtracking.com more closely (with Kostya), I found that the quality was not ideal. There were quite a few days where NY just didn’t report any negative cases… Such is real-world data, I guess. With sports, the data quality is usually much higher. When I’m modeling sports, I feel pretty confident that whatever data is captured is done in a relatively consistent way across games and seasons (still not perfect). It really is a great playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;masks&quot;&gt;Masks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard conflicting information about the efficacy of masks. The WHO dismisses their usefulness as a protective measure for healthy people, and Michael Osterholm (epidemiologist expert) echoed it on Joe Rogan’s podcast a couple weeks ago. However, I have also seen a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLrm0pqBN_5bdyysOeoOBX4pt4oFDBhsC_jpblXpNtQ/edit&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; compiling a list of studies that claim that masks are helpful! There’s just so much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; on the internet that you will get exactly what you search for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to believe. Now that the level of seriousness has been ratcheted up, I feel much more aware of how easily misinformation or even half-truths can be spread on social media. This doesn’t feel like the malicious fake news campaigns from the 2016 election, but more an overconfidence in something where the truth is not known. If anyone asks me if masks are effective, I’ll fall back to “I don’t know,” but if I have to go to the grocery store, I’ll take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager&quot;&gt;Pascal’s wager&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">People love to read too much into dumb headlines.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffma/status/1242246589395001351&quot;&gt;Bet the Process&lt;/a&gt; episode recorded at Sloan came out today. Interviews with Ted Knutson and Jeff Yass were both insightful. Knutson was pretty negative about the prospects of a thriving regulated &amp;amp; legalized betting market in the US. Or more specifically it’d only be for recreational bettors. Yass talked about how at SIG they teach all the new traders to play poker first to learn about variance and process-oriented decision making. I think that’s really cool! I’m not good at poker, but those aspects of the game appeal to me as well. Playing games with a mix of luck and skill is way more fun than a game like chess, which is a perfect information all skill game. Actually, not only is it way more fun, it is a much more realistic representation of the real world where we never have perfect information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got in my first slightly longer run in a while…somehow haven’t run more than like 5 miles since like 2018? I had to keep reminding myself during the run to relax and not push the pace. Cardio-wise I can handle more miles and at a faster pace, but I know that I’ll get injured doing that. Gotta have patience in building up running fitness. Definitely something that I never had before when I did a little bit of triathlon. I planned out my workouts for the week and I hope I’ll be able to follow the plan. For morning workouts, the battle is always fought the night before – sleep early enough and getting up isn’t so horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belated. Started the other day, but finished reading Ben Falk’s interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleaningtheglass.com/following-the-smoke/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on using CDC’s data on influenza to infer where the next (reported) coronavirus outbreaks will be. Put another way, the influenza data is probably a &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; indicator to the confirmed cases that the news will report on. I just complained about everyone incessantly tweeting out the reported cases data without context, but Ben actually looked into it! 100% worth a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cleaningtheglass.com/following-the-smoke/&quot;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; for a fresher take on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Weeds on Trump’s swamp&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t even know why I listened to this. Was like half listening tbh. I know people have talked about this before, but sometimes part of the appeal of podcasts is that I feel like I’m in a room with the hosts, and they’re almost like my friends or something. It’s almost a conversation, except they won’t get mad if I’m multitasking (and that I don’t have any input). And after listening to the same podcasts for a while, there’s like a build up of social intimacy. In this time of sheltering in place, that feeling seems even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve read anything else I’ve written about this, you know how I feel about that. What a fucking waste of time for people. Some brainless “data scientist” is definitely trying to XGBoost their way through this…and oh boy, garbage in garbage out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Got in my first slightly longer run in a while…somehow haven’t run more than like 5 miles since like 2018? I had to keep reminding myself during the run to relax and not push the pace. Cardio-wise I can handle more miles and at a faster pace, but I know that I’ll get injured doing that. Gotta have patience in building up running fitness. Definitely something that I never had before when I did a little bit of triathlon. I planned out my workouts for the week and I hope I’ll be able to follow the plan. For morning workouts, the battle is always fought the night before – sleep early enough and getting up isn’t so horrible.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Daily: No cars</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/21/daily.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Daily: No cars" /><published>2020-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/03/21/daily</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/03/21/daily.html">&lt;p&gt;Life would be amazing without so many cars in SF.

&lt;p&gt;GoPros are cool. Rode my bike. Only got in two rides this week, but feeling quite a bit stronger already. I’ll up the mileage next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t believe I listened to a podcast about fantasy Top Chef basically. Two NBA media people (Arnowitz / Haberstroh) are the hosts: &lt;a href=&quot;https://packyourknives.libsyn.com/&quot;&gt;Pack Your Knives&lt;/a&gt;
I guess this is where I am without sports :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewatched Super Size Me on YouTube in the background.
I haven’t watched Top Chef in a long time, but a friend recommended me to watch the latest season that just premiered. Seems like I might have fun following it since there aren’t going to be sports for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;articles&quot;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read a friend’s draft for a blog post. Otherwise, again I’m illiterate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listened to one of the recent Invest Like the Best episodes. While latently interesting, there’s nothing really actionable from it. Not really into trading stock- I think it’s pretty -EV. Just a completely time and energy sink. And plus, if you really new something, you probably wouldn’t give it away for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;all this coronavirus discourse gave me the sickness of wasting brain cycles on keeping up with whats going on in the stock market&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; canzhi is at home right now (@canzhiye) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/canzhiye/status/1236886262247612416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about doing some covid-19 modeling. I’ll read through the metholodogies of what’s currently out there and see if I have anything to add. If not, I’ll leave it up to Smart People. Just want to once again harp on the point that modeling confirmed cases seems very unwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Saw this before bed, and I swear I came to the above opinion independently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re have no way of measuring the number of cases.

&lt;p&gt;Did a ton of errands and not that much coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twitter-observations&quot;&gt;Twitter observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw the alleged insider trading stuff about Kelly Loeffler and other congresspeople. Led me down a small rabithole of learning about how they disclose &lt;a href=&quot;https://efdsearch.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;transactions&lt;/a&gt;. Found that other people already scrape it, and I’m sure smart finance people either already look at it or that it comes out so much after the fact that it doesn’t even matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;articles&quot;&gt;Articles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. Apparently I’m illiterate if not consuming info in 280 character chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was missing Dan Carlin’s voice, but didn’t want to commit to a relisten of one of his marathon episodes, so I found his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/dan-carlins/ep7-hardcore-history-on-fire-LoqpQ-NWlCD/&quot;&gt;Addendum podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Listened to his conversation about the political spectrum, and he definitely dates himself here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea why I listened to this one about coronavirus on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-weeds/rescuing-the-economy-from-3hF07CM5bf6/&quot;&gt;Weeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet buddy went on a niche &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqwDu_e3Vg&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; about betting basketball and a bunch of random stuff. My favorite type of podcast– low production quality, raw, and information-dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSBxzFH9eLI&quot;&gt;very dumb but I chuckled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 2% of NBA players have coronavirus! Obviously they interact with way more people than the average person, but still interesting to think about how many people in the US would test positive if we could magically get tests for everyone right now. Partially because of this, I’m stil unconvinced that forecasting based on &lt;em&gt;confirmed&lt;/em&gt; cases is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qefX0vIn2aM&quot;&gt;cool video&lt;/a&gt; and gave it a shot myself… chemistry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had really solid flow throughout the day by keeping the phone far away, but after being distracted in the afternoon it was hard to context switch back and get back into flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twitter-observations&quot;&gt;Twitter observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing some rumblings about pandemic affecting jobs in tech. Also saw some pessimism towards the fundraising environment, but I wonder how much that applies to early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been posting the exponential growth charts of coronavirus for a couple weeks now, but I think more nuance is entering the discussion especially since the data quality is not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I can&amp;#39;t shake the feeling that this is the biggest GIGO event in modern history. Everyone keeps writing &amp;quot;confirmed case&amp;quot; counts by country, which have only a very loose relationship with the actual counts.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrew Johnson (@CountingBaskets) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CountingBaskets/status/1239931708281159687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalizing for testing! Yes! I’ve been kinda harping on this for like the last week. In that vein, I kinda wanna see a deaths-added metric (deaths over expected), which adjust for demographic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;totally&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/5dfPCERveZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/5dfPCERveZ&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite source i&amp;#39;ve seen for that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a better metric that could be made to look at growth as percentage of market normalizing for testing. But yeah, this is just the chart I pull for myself every day&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qcLHeFZoDz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qcLHeFZoDz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kevin Kwok (@kevinakwok) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kevinakwok/status/1240506582875516929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;podcasts&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished up the final episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/3MW_CBB&quot;&gt;Three Man Weave&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t get to watch a ton of college basketball this year, but still followed it quite closely. Obviously pretty sad that the season was cut short of the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jeffma/status/1240448838004953088&quot;&gt;Bet the Process&lt;/a&gt;. They were pretty self-aware about adding more noise to the coronavirus discussion, but I did enjoy their thought &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; around trying to forecast it. NFL talk seems so… wrong… with every other sport being held in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;videos&quot;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re all trapped at home, I think I’ll try to learn to cook / make a few new things. Same ole stuff getting tiring, so I watched some cooking videos on Youtube.
Browsed a couple NRL highlights since that’s like the only sport still going on. They should suspend their season though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misc&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of uncertainty everywhere! Friend showed me a couple graphs I found interesting as someone who knows basically nothing about finance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) most volatile since 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/volatility.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) everything very correlated&lt;/p&gt;

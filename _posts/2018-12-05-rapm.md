trailing 250 and 500 day (excluding offseason) regular season RAPM. updated nightly. 

(this is a really early version right now. would love suggestions.)

[what is rapm?](https://www.google.com/search?q=rapm+nba+explanation&oq=rapm+nba+explanation)


why 250 and 500 day samples?    
there is a ton of noise in RAPM for small samples. the single-season RAPM numbers that are floating out there suffer from this. 250 game days is about 1.5 seasons, and 500 game days is about 3 seasons.

a few technical details:

- ridge regression (use cross-validation to find "best" regularization parameter)
- some possessions played cutoff that regresses about 1/5th of the players toward a ~replacement level~ player
- please tweet / dm me [@canzhiye](https://twitter.com/canzhiye) any suggestions or questions

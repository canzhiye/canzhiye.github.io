As usual, spent most of the day in front of the computer... which is currently a 55" TV. I basically have 4 screens at once and it works decently.

Stupid me forgot that I washed my bike jerseys yesterday so they were still wet and I couldn't ride this morning.

Excited for tomorrow!


### Twitter observations
Surprisingly did a good job of staying off this hellhole today.

### Articles
Read a friend's draft for a blog post. Otherwise, again I'm illiterate.

### Podcasts
Listened to one of the recent Invest Like the Best episodes. While latently interesting, there's nothing really actionable from it. Not really into trading stock- I think it's pretty -EV. Just a completely time and energy sink. And plus, if you really new something, you probably wouldn't give it away for free.

### Videos
Nothing.

### Misc
Thinking about doing some covid-19 modeling. I'll read through the metholodogies of what's currently out there and see if I have anything to add. If not, I'll leave it up to Smart People. Just want to once again harp on the point that modeling confirmed cases seems very unwise.

UPDATE: Saw this before bed, and I swear I came to the above opinion independently!

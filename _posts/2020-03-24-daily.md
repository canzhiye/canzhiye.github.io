Ran in the rain today. Did a couple miles a little faster in the middle of the run. Lower calves don't feel great, so rest of week of running will be much easier / slower.

Wrote some code for a little project that will hopefully launch this weekend :) 

### Twitter
Keith vs Zach lol [some of it here](https://twitter.com/zachweinberg/status/1242643587243876353)

I don't know anything here, so abstaining from commentary.

### Podcasts
The Weeds on what to do with industry in times like these. Some comparisons to Ford, factories, etc producing necessary things in WWII. It's like a car crash - I can't not pay attention.

### Misc
Still looking to take a deeper dive into the covid data. Lack of domain knowledge caveat applies here, but I think I have a few ideas on how I can add something to the discussion without being absolutely destroyed like [@aginnt](https://twitter.com/aginnt). Main thing I want to look at is incorporating testing and demographic data to contextualize the confirmed cases graphs I see everywhere.

The situation around KAT's mom is really sad. Very brave of him to get in front of a camera and deliver this message.

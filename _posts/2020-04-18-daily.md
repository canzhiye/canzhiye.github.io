I had a fun time finding some really streets to climb in SF. Without tourists, I even got to go up the wiggly Lombard St. Afterwards I counted the cogs on my cassette and realized it's an 11-30, which means I still have some room to get gears better for climbing. I never anticipate really ever having to use that though, so I probably won't do it.

### Twitter
There's a new social app that's all the rage- Clubhouse. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s your first look at Clubhouse, the app every VC is talking about <a href="https://t.co/xIdqnz8DS8">https://t.co/xIdqnz8DS8</a></p>&mdash; joshconstine (@JoshConstine) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshConstine/status/1251668138543874048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's a spontaneuous audio group chat app, and twitter was just bunch of clubhouse takes today.

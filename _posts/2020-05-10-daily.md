I have a huge backlog of things I want to write a little bit about. The following is what I get to in fifteen minutes. More tomorrow!

I want to build something that indexes all the contents of the tweets I like. Then make it searchable. And also have it email me in the evening, with tweets clustered roughly by category. It will make writing this thing daily much easier. As Michael said on his [blog/journal](https://www.notion.so/085cddc60dec458fae34d17ef203817d?v=1e992ea21eb245f5862efa0b05e8cce3&p=854c9b02753444b5a20b2fdaaefa3aeb) (inspired by me apparently!), "it's easier to react to things than to come up with original thoughts." I like tweets usually because they make me think, and if I don't get a chance to write those things down, they disappear into the ether...

I am working with a good friend on building out a v1 of a new audio sharing app - [inca.fm](https://www.inca.fm/).

[@ballfakebot](https://twitter.com/Ballfakebot), which I wrote a tiny bit about on 4/26 has picked up some followers! There is a deep-seated desire for sports and this weird text-only simulation can feed it...just a bit.

### Twitter
From 4/26:
"I switched my feed to chronological a couple days ago. Maybe it'll help me stop doing the doom scrolling for the first and last 30 mins of my day. I think it will probably make my feed worse, as in less interesting, but maybe that will help me reduce Twitter screen time." (block quote)

This worked out very poorly. I follow too many people for chronological to work -- really felt like I was drinking from a firehose. Back to algorithmic feed.

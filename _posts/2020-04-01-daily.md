### Work
I'm doing some contracting for a friend. Cool to be doing iOS work again. Kind of back to my roots. I can't believe it's been over 10 years since I first downloaded Xcode and learned to code. Now I get to do much cooler stuff of course :) 

## Workout
I got new running shoes, or really they're just a new pair of the old shoes I had. Especially in these times, I'll opt for exploit over explore. 

## Reading

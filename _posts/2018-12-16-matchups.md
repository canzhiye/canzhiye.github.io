using the matchup data on the nba stats site, I created a graph with nodes being players and edges weighted by how much players guarded each other. I ran [louvain community detection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity) on it and it found 4 communities. this means there’s “naturally” 4 positions!

this isn’t a particularly surprising insight at all. it’s cool to see it borne out in the data though!

in this second visualization, I took the matchup graph and ran [node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) on it. this embeds the nodes of the graph in high-dimensional space. presumably, players of the same position will be "close" to each other in this high dimensional space. I then used t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality so that it's suitable for viewing.

disclaimer: I know the matchup data itself is not great and it's not totally clear what constitutes a "matchup" between two players. A little discussion on that [here](https://twitter.com/Squared2020/status/1074006259307765760).
